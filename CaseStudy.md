## Genesis
Without a doubt, we are living in a turbulent age of technological innovation. With everything being digitized; from newspapers, to business,
to even our financial systems, it's rather difficult to resist adaptation. We've progressed from trading goods and servides, to trading paper
bills in lieu of goods (or gold), we've constantly progressed in the direction of simplicity. Eventually, it became normal to swipe pieces 
of plastic that hold access to our bank accounts, which are merely digitized records of our physical wealth. 

In the last decade, we've seen the digitization of currency itself. Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted, and 
decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. 
Instead, these tasks are vastly distributed among blockchain users via the internet.

In February of 2015, a trailblazing company by the name of Coinsource was founded by Bobby Sharp, Travis Gough, and Sheffield Clarke. From 
the onset, their goal was to provide millions of Americans with a reliably convenient way to purchase digital currency. Sheffield Clarke 
stated that Bitcoin ATMs are paramount in taking solid steps towards general adoption. They're a privately funded company that seems to have 
had zero issuesising over $50 million dollars.

Coinsourece utilizes GenesisCoin software, with custom Genesis hardware to match. Unlike the first generation of Bitcoin ATMâ€™s, Genesis 
hardware and software have successfully eliminated the tedious biometric elements of the KYC process while simultaneously providing the 
operator with new and improved ways to implement KYC and AML policies and procedures that more than satisfy regulatory requirements.

## Gameplan
The company seeks to bring digital currency adaptability to the center of attention for all unbanked and underbanked Americans. Many 
individuals find themselves shut out from the modern banking system due to lack of documentation and lack of technological asccess. But when 
it comes to cryptocurrency, all you need is a valid Driver's license, and a valid payment method (cash/card) and you're good to go. There is 
no middle man granting permission to access your own funds, and there's very little fraud possibility with this tech.

Over the last 5 years, the industry as a whole has seen explosive growth. Coinsource marched from city to city, planting seeds, then expanding 
operations, in an admirably methodical expansionist crusade. In 2017, one such city was Atlanta, Georgia. Regional demand allowed coinsource 
to scale up from two measley machines, all the way to 20 machines in the metropolitan area. This growth can be attributed to the virality of 
Bitcoin in 2017,when the digital asset hit its preivious all time high in the fourth quarter. 

In a relatively short amount of time, coinsource expanded operations from the state of New York, to roughly 80% of all states in North America. 
They've even statsed numerous times their intent to expand internationally, in order to truly connect with all members of their target audience, 
those who lack a reliable, centralized banking system in which they can confide their finances in.

Bitcoin ATM machines typically charge a nine percent per transaction fee, whereas the founders of Coinsource decided to start at 8%. Coinsource 
prides itself upon its smaller fees. It may not seem like much, but that extra one percent can really go a long way. It is documented that most 
machines see an average of $30,000 in transactions flowing through them. Some machines in high-traffic areas have had months where they see over 
$100,000 in monthly volume. Bobby Sharp, co-founder fo the company said "as the price per coin churns towards the famed hundred thousand mark, 
the real-estate value of each machine rises too. We'll be seeing many more six-figure motnhs as the market nears its cap on circulating bitcoin."

## Impact
In litte more than five years, this company has expanded to 39 states, positively impacting the lives of thousands of individuals with the power 
of blockchain banking. By placing this revolutionary technology within arm's reach of many, they've also help speed up the greatest transfer of 
wealth this generation will have the privilege of witnessing firsthand. We are already nearing the late stages of adaptation, but we must still 
find ways to implement and innovate the technology. 

There are four key metrics that determine the company's level of success, and they are as follows:
* Quantity of ATM machines they have stationed
* Volume of ATM transactions
* Current price of Bitcoin
* Quantity of ATM transaction

With 560 machines currently active across the country, producing a high yield of high volume transactions, it is safe to assume that Coinsource 
is currently prospering, and exceeding their metrics for success, *especially* with BTC breaking a new record high price. One of their top 
competitors, Digital Mint, came close with a total of 414 machines, but alas, their growth became stagnant during the pandemic, while Coinsource 
seized the situation as an opportunity.

## Recommendation

If I were to recommend the addition of any new services to this company, Id strongly urge them to get into the business of smart contract lending. 
With companies such as SALT already capitlaizing on the obvious opportunity to combine financial agreements with an airtight, unbreachable digital 
ledger; the company only stands to benefit from this new automated suystem of collecting fees. The purchase and/or sale of bitcoin with any of 
Coinsource's machines requires the creation of an account, along with basic identification confirmation information. They already have what it 
takes to upgrade the financial services they offer. Consider this; if the purpose of decentralized, digital currency is to replace the functions  
of a centralized bank, why not remove their loan function as well? Peer-to-peer blockchain lending, blockchain business loans, mortgages... 
The oly issue they'd have with this would be the marketing aspects of launching this business venture, however with 560 machines nationwide, those 
are 560 potential screens that can be used to advertise whatever they'd like, at no additional cost. As a matter of fact, another business 
recomendation I would offer coinbase would be optimizing their marketing potential by charging third party vendors a fee to advertise their 
goods/services on their machines. A weekly rent paid by those who wish to advertise themselves to the consumers of the cryptocurrency future.
